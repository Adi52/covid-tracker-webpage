## General info

Do you want to know how much cases of covid19 is now all around the World, or in your Country? You can check it on my website!

On this website, you can see the world map first and below it several data such as:
- death cases, 
- confirmed cases, 
- active cases, 
- recovered cases,
- chart with the daily increase in infected,
- the latest news from the world of covid19

You can choose the country you are interested in, on the map. Another way to choose a target is to use an intelligent search engine that will show you all the possibilities.

Then the tiles and news are updated.

## Availability :computer:
Webpage is full responsive. You can see clearly data in any device.

## Status
Project is: `finished`. I don’t plan to expand this, only a fix for bugs found.


## Inspiration
I wanted to make this type of website because I wanted to apply all the knowledge I had gained in the last six months in one project. Things like **BEM methodology**, **Webpack**, **npm**, **es modules**, **node.js**, **fetch API**, **SASS preprocessor**, **responsiveness**, **accessibility**, **flexbox**, **SVG** are used here.
